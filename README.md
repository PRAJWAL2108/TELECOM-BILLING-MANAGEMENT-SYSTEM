## TELECOM-BILLING-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

Telecom Billing is a process of collecting usage, aggregating it, applying required usage charges, and finally generating invoices for the customers. 

Telecom Billing process also includes receiving and recording payments from the customers.

There could be very complex charging scenarios, which would be difficult to handle manually. 

There are state-of-the-art Billing Systems available in the software market that can handle billing tasks very efficiently and provide lots of flexibilities to service providers to offer their services with different price structures.

Billing systems are often viewed as accounts receivable, as the billing system assists in the collection (receipt) of money from customers. 

Billing systems are also part of accounts payable, as customers often use services from other companies such as wireless roaming, long distance, and call completion through other networks.

With this mini project in C Telecom Billing System, the user can perform and manage billing operations like they do in Telecom companies.

Here, the user can add records with name, phone number and the amount of payment. 

The user can view, modify and search existing records.

The user can also make payment by providing your phone number instead of name. 

All data added or modified are recorded in a file. 

This project will teach you how to add, list, edit, search and delete records using file handling.
